			<p class="post">My name is Micah Harrison and I am a 18 year old intended Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley.
				I grew up in the beautiful Pomona, California where I graduated from Garey High School in 2016. While in high school, I was always interested
				the hardware of gaming consoles and, after learning the functions of each part of a console, I actually got paid by some of my friends to repair their systems.
				Not knowing anything about the software side of Computer Science, I took a small web development course during my senior
				year of high school and the idea of being able to create incredible projects at the tip of your fingers led me to choose Computer Science as my major.
                A year and a half later and I am now a sophomore at Berkeley.</p>

                    become proficient in coding in Python and Scheme and I am currently learning Java. I am comfortable working with various data types and I am eager to learn as
                    much as I can to become a useful asset in the world of CS. In my spare time, I do try to work on little projects such as this very website.

                    At this company, I work as a Jr. Project manager. My responsibilities included organizing time and material sheets for proper billing, acting as a head of a diverse group of electricians, and completing and presenting bills of sales to customers in order to finalize transactions.

                    At Raging Waters I operated in the Admissions department as a Cashier/ Guest Services. As a Cashier, I would handle large amounts of money while selling tickets to be admitted into the water park. Guest Services allowed me to help and handle customers that have any comments, complaints, or concerns. Whether they just needed a map of the park or they were unhappy with their visit, I would work to the best of my ability to fulfill their requests.(Picture on the left is Admissions department moments away from victory in volleyball)

                    While working at Clark Kerr Unit for UC Berkeley, I managed the mailroom, front office, and Assistant Student Learning Center. I utilized organizational skills in the mailroom sorting mail appropriately so that it ran smoothly and my customer service background helped me to handle students with any issues they may have with their living quarters at the front desk. In the ASC, I helped students with any issues using University computers or printers.
