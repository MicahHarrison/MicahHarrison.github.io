		In this project, I learned how to use Tensorflow models to get a cool object detection model up and running. Getting the default tensorflow object detection model to work was fun and all but the best part was learning how to train a default model to recognize custom objects. With this incredible oppurtunity to train it to recognize anything in the world, it only seemed logical to teach it to recognize mac-n-cheese and hotdogs so thats exaclty what I did. I then adapted the model to work with live video using open-CV but this result in a sort of laggy experience. Luckily enough in my search to improve the experience, I found that it worked best when adapted to process pre-recorded video like the one provided as an example on the left. Now I lead this project in a CS club I am a part of called Codeology. I help 9+ club members develop this project over a 4 week period. I teach different key concepts of machine learning along the way to help members get a taste of what machine learning is all about.</p>
