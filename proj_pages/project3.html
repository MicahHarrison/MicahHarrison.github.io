		This was one of my favorite projects to work on. Intrestlingly, this started off as a crowdsource type of game for a relitively famous youtuber but out of the 15-ish programmers to sign up to help, I was the only one that actually worked on it and I loved it. Before this, I had no experience in Unity or C# but game development has always been an intrest of mine so out of curiosity, I took it upon myself to learn this new tech. Using youtube tutorials, unity documentation, and free sprites I was able to build a working 2d beat-em-up style game complete with user preferance controls, a player upgrade sytem, and save game mechanics. I even learned how to package the game into an installer so if you are truly interested in playing, I can send you a downloader and you can try it yourself!</p>
