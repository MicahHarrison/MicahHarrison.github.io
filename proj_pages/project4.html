		This was probably on of the more challenging and rewarding projects I was a part of. Gitlet was an academic project where we were tasked with builing a program, from scratch, to mimic the features of Git. By starting from scratch we were able to design our program however we liked and we learned the in's and out's of how merging, branching, and pushing worked within Git. Written entirely in Java, we were able to showcase our abilities in object oriented programing and demonstrate our knowledge of various data structures. </p>
